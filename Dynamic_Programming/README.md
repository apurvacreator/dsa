## Dynamic Programming

Solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results to avoid redundant computation

1. **Overlapping subproblems** - A problem exhibits optimal substructure if its solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems

2. **Optimal substructures** - A problem exhibits optimal substructure if its solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems
