## Dynamic Programming

Solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results to avoid redundant computation

1. **Overlapping subproblems** - A problem has overlapping subproblems if it can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are reused multiple times

2. **Optimal substructures** - A problem exhibits optimal substructure if its solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems
